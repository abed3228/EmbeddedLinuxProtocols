## General Overview

- Introduction to networking in embedded Linux systems.
- Key differences and use cases for TCP and UDP.

## TCP Networking

- Description: Overview of TCP, a connection-oriented protocol ensuring reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data.
- Usage: Discuss how TCP is utilized in the project.
- Setting Up TCP Connections: Steps to establish TCP connections in embedded Linux.
- Code Snippets: Basic examples of creating and managing TCP connections.

## UDP Networking

- Description: Overview of UDP, a simpler, connectionless Internet protocol that allows sending datagrams without establishing a connection.
- Usage: Describe how UDP is implemented in the project.
- Setting Up UDP Communications: Instructions for setting up and using UDP.
- Code Snippets: Simple examples of UDP communication.
