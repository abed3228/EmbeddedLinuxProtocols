## General Overview

- Brief introduction to embedded Linux systems.
- Importance of low-level interfaces in embedded systems.

## GPIO

- Description: General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) is a digital signal pin in a microcontroller that can be controlled (high/low) by software.
- Usage: Explain how GPIO is used in your project.
- Configuration: Steps to configure GPIO pins in your system.
- Code Snippets: Include basic code examples for GPIO operations.

## UART

- Description: Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) is a hardware communication protocol used for serial communication.
- Usage: Describe how UART is implemented in your project.
- Configuration: Provide instructions for setting up UART communication.
- Code Snippets: Show simple examples of UART communication.

## SPI

- Description: Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is a synchronous serial communication interface used for short-distance communication.
- Usage: Illustrate how SPI is used in your embedded system.
- Configuration: Detail the steps for configuring SPI devices.
- Code Snippets: Include basic usage examples for SPI communication.

## I2C

- Description: Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) is a multi-master, multi-slave, packet switched, single-ended, serial communication bus.
- Usage: Explain the role of I2C in your project.
- Configuration: Instructions on how to set up I2C communication.
- Code Snippets: Provide simple I2C communication examples.
